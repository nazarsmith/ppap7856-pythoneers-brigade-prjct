## Additional Notes

1. Currently, it is not possible to add a contact with a name only. Both `name` and a `phone number` must be provided;
2. Calling the command again with the same name will add another phone number to the same contact;
3. `name` - a string with a minimum of 1 character and a maximum of 30 characters;
4. `phone number` - only numbers, 10 characters;
5. `birthday` - the format is DD.MM.YYYY;
6. `email` - a string, the format is example@example.com;
7. `address` - a string that may contain spaces, commas, periods, etc.; the address contains from 10 to 100 characters;
8. `text` - a string that can contain spaces, commas, periods, etc.; during note creation, it is assigned a ordinal number for management;
9. The PA saves the progress upon exiting; this does not apply to the cases when it is forcefully shut down (e.g. keyboard interrupt);
10. The PA supports machine-learning enabled intent recognition for all the intents except for:

- show-phone
- num-contacts
- add-address
- change-address
- show-address
- delete-address
+ these commands must be entered the way they are written above.
